## Proposal :
In this project, is about using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module to build a landmark classifier. 
The model should automatically be able to predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image.

## The project goes through :
training a deep learning model using CNN to detect and classify landmarks. Basically, :
Creating a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch)
Creating  a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning)
Write a Landmark Prediction Algorithm
