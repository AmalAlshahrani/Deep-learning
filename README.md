# Deep-learning project
This project will be about building the neural network which classifies the landmarks images into 5 categories (building, sea, street, glacier, mountain)
The workflow of entire project goes through 
-	Making the base line of neural network  

-	Building the Convolutional neural network      -       (In -progress )
-	Testing the model on unable dataset to ensure if the model can be classifying the images according to its categories or not!



Note :the accuracy will be compared to decide who is the model work well !


thes images below represnts 3 categories of landmark images :
