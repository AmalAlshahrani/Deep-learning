# Deep-learning project
In this project, is about using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module to build a landmark classifier. The model should automatically be able to predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image.

The project goes through :
training a deep learning model using CNN to detect and classify landmarks. Basically, : Creating a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch) Creating a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning) Write a Landmark Prediction Algorithm.

expected result :
